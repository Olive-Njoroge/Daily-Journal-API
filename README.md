# Journal App â€” My First Fullstack Application ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

I am beyond excited to share this project â€” my very first fullstack application! Building this journal app has been a fantastic learning journey, connecting my frontend React skills with backend Express and MongoDB for the first time. 

This app allows users to create journal entries and stores them in a MongoDB database through an Express API. Itâ€™s simple but powerful, and it feels amazing to see everything working together seamlessly!

## Features

- Add new journal entries with a title and content
- Frontend built with React and Vite
- Backend API powered by Express and MongoDB
- CORS enabled for smooth frontend-backend communication
- Basic error handling on both frontend and backend

## How to Run

### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend folder (or root if single folder)
2. Run `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
3. Start the server with `pnpm start` (or `node index.js`)

Make sure MongoDB is running and the connection URI is correctly set.

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Express
- MongoDB
- pnpm
- CORS

## Final Thoughts

Building this fullstack journal app has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my coding journey so far. Itâ€™s a proud milestone â€” Iâ€™ve connected everything from frontend form inputs, API calls, server logic, to database storage. 

This project inspires me to keep pushing forward, learning, and building more complex applications. Hereâ€™s to many more fullstack apps in the future! ðŸ¥³ðŸš€
